Emmet - generates code inside vs code (powerful, smooth coding experience, best for front end dev)

html:5 enter - gives basic HTML structure

CDN - place where React library is hosted 
using CDN links in the script tag is one of the way(costly and many network calls happen) to bring react into our project which is not a preferred way
Other way is use npm since we already have it in node_modules
-------------------------------------------
props are attributes of an element that goes as children of that element
-------------------------------------------
const heading = React.createElement(
  "h1",
  { id: "heading", className: "randomClassName" }, ----- PROPS of h1 tag
  "Hello World from React!"
);
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(heading);
-------------------------------------------
ReactElement(Object) ===> HTML(Browser Understands)

React.createElement ===> always creates an Object
that object becomes tag while rendering through render method
-------------------------------------------
core of react is :
React.createElement("div", { id: "child1" }, [
    React.createElement("h1", {}, "I am h1 tag"),
    React.createElement("h2", {}, "I am h2 tag"),
  ]),
  React.createElement("div", { id: "child2" }, [
    React.createElement("h1", {}, "I am h1 tag"),
    React.createElement("h2", {}, "I am h2 tag"),
  ])

JSX makes it easy while creating tags.
-------------------------------------------

Order of script tag files matter.

for example: app.js cannot be prior to reacr and reactdomcdn links

git init : to initialise the git repository

git branch -M main : creates main as the main/master branch

git and github are two different things --- Read about it

github is a place where one can host git repositories

I get into this issue too. The reason is that I didn't have any commit on this git repository.

When I run the command git branch -M main. I get the following error message.

error: refname refs/heads/master not found
fatal: Branch rename failed
After I add my first commit by the following command, all things work.

git add .
git commit -m 'Init'

npm 
-standard repository for all the packages
-one of the biggest package managers
-all the libraries/packages utilities are hosted in npm
-bts works as a node package manager but does not abbreviate/stand for node package manager
-when you create a basic react app it already has npm in it but you should know how to use npm

jshree@JayashreesAir3 hello-react % npm init
This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

See `npm help init` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install <pkg>` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

This results in a new file in the project called "package.json" (which is a configuration for npm)

npm - package manager - manages packages that we'll install -  packages are nothing but dependencies

npm will take care of the version of those packages in the package.json 

most imp package in project is 'bundler' and examples are webpack,parcel and vite etc

Bundlers bundle up Javascript,css, images and etc altogether

when we create a create react app uses webpack bundler and babel behind the scenes

In our current project we use 'parcel'
parcel is one of the best libraries out there which we will use to ignite our app.

if the app is skeleton parcel add ons the muscle to strengthen the app
parcel comes as the node package we install through npm

to install any dependency or package use : npm install -D parcel

why -D???

Dependencies are two types basically:
1.dev dependency : which is generally required in the development Phase
2.normal dependency : which is used in production

^ caret (^2.8.3) : to update minor(2.8.4) versions automatically 
~ tilde (^2.8.3) : to update major(3.8.4) versions automatically

npm install -D parcel
- above command adds parcel dependency and its version
- above command also results in new file called pacage-lock.json keeps 
  the recoed of exact version of that dependency installed

    pacage-lock.json is very imp as it keeps the hash of all the 
    versions on your machine that can be tracked when pushed to production
- this also installs a folder called "node_modules"

so basically, package.json is cnfiguration for npm
node_modules is the database 

package.json consists of the 'dependencies/packages' and its version but
node_modules consists of all the code of the dependencies/packages

node modules consists of lot of folders in it, since a dependency has inturn a lot of dependencies

node modules is a huge file and
absolutely no need to push it to git hub.
you can add them it to git ignore

but package.json and packagelock.json, 
should definitely be pushed to github

just by having the above files we can create node_modules folder by running "npm install" command

basically add only essential files in the git
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ignite the app by 
"npx parcel index.html"
here,
index.html is the source file of the object

so, parcel created a server(at port 1234) for us

npm install : installs a package
npx : EXECUTES a package
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CDN links is not a good way to bring react into project 
(why?)
fetching from cdn is a costly call

In the process of fetching from CDN a call is made to unpkg.com to get react but suppose if we already have react in our 
node modules(which we get from npm) it would be a lot easier to manage all our dependencies and react as well asone of the 
dependency

React is nothing but -libraries written in Javascript - which is hosted on npm.
One can get React into the project via npm
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
npm install react, npm install react-dom (no -D since it is normal dependency not a development dependency)
which installs react and reactDOM dependency in package-lock.json, package.json and also 
under node_modules

install - i can also be used

<script type="module" src="./App.js"></script>

type="module" is to avoid browser script cannot contain imports
to say that the script tag is not the regular Javascript

At this step I faced a problem of 

Problem:
I am in the Episode 02 part 02 of "Igniting the App" section where we remove CDN links and add <script type="module" src="./App.js"></script>  in index.html & add
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
in app.js.

results in

Error: Expected content key de1e4a02ec63c4eb to exist

  Error: Expected content key de1e4a02ec63c4eb to exist
      at nullthrows (/Users/jshree/Desktop/hello-react/node_modules/nullthrows/nullthrows.js:7:15)
      at AssetGraph.getNodeIdByContentKey 

Solution:
delete parcel cache.
Clear the node_modules and reinstall the dependenices again. 

I deleted node_modules and ran npm install and npx parcel index.html to initiate server

----------------------------------------------------------

In our HTML we are injecting app.js , it treats app.js as a normal Javascript and normal JS does not have import

But in our App.js we have import statements.So to announce App.js as not a regular Javascript 
we write thetype as "module"

<script type="module" src="./App.js"></script>

and add
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
results in
Warning: You are importing createRoot from "react-dom" which is not supported. You should instead import it from "react-dom/client".
fix:
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  "name": "hello-react",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "This is Hello React by Jayashree Rangu",
  "main": "App.js"

Remove 
"main": "App.js", from pakage.json since it gets in conflict with parcel where parcel sees index.html as 
an entry point whereas in package.json "main": "App.js" indicates app.js as entry point.

so remove that line before executing the below command
npx parcel build index.html --> prod build
- it'll bundle,minify and put all those files in "dist" folder (parcel-cache, node_modules, dist can be automatically generated and need not to be in github
just add them in gitignore)

Browserslist is an npm package (it needs some configuration)
goto browserlist.dev such a powerful tool

You have to tell yur project what all browsers should your app be supported in by adding browserslist in package.json
example:
"browserslist": [
    "last 2 chrome version",
    "last 2 Firefox version"
  ]
